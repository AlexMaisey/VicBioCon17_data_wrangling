## Bat Data Analysis Questions to explore:

- whats the most common species?
        - number of sites observed at 
        - mean richness
- respnse variables to explore:
        - diversity / richness
        - abundance / activity
        - relative abundance (percentage of recorded calls of each species, figure 3 in Tanja's paper)
- what "story" can we tell? what suite of questions can we put together to tell an interesting data analysis story / frame as detective work.

## Code Points to learn:

- data wrangling model
- Dplyr verbs
- Data tidying - replacing values, e.g. spelling mistakes
- species lookup tables
- Different types of plots:
        - one response var + discrete predictor var
        - one response var + continuous predictor var
        
        
### Todos:

- Aptitude / confidence survey for participants (decide where to pitch and cutoff content)
- Instructions for installing R / Rstudio and all materials
- Wifi password?
- schedule (survey / email)
