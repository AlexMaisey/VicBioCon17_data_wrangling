We will focus on how to read plain-text rectangular files into R.
`readr::read_csv()` reads comma delimited files. I.e. tabular data stored as plain-text with each value in a row delimited by a comma, and usually ending in the file extension `.csv`.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
#get some dummy data here.
#readr::read_csv()
```
