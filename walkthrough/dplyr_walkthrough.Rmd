## What is 'dplyr', and you should use it for data wrangling

dplyr makes wrangling your data frames a breeze. dplyr is a metaphorical set of ‘pliers’ for wrangling your data frames (d-plyr, duh), to do things like row- or column-wise subsetting, conduct group-wise operations on multiple subsets of data, or merge data frame and matching rows by value rather than position. Using dplyr (rather than base R) means that common data manipulation problems take less code and less mental effort to write. Moreover, much of dplyr’s work is implemented behind the scenes in C++ code, making wrangling larger data frames lightning-fast!
